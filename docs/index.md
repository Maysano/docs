# Maysano

Maysano is an operating layer for governed data products.

It provides a structured environment where organizations define, version, govern, and operate data products with clear accountability and measurable business intent. Instead of treating data as isolated technical assets, Maysano ensures every product is linked to a business objective, owned by defined roles, and controlled through reusable governance components.

The platform connects strategy, governance, and execution in one coherent model. It enforces lifecycle discipline aligned with ODPS, separates policy from evidence, and makes drift, quality, and ownership visible.

Maysano does not replace metadata platforms, data warehouses, or pipelines. It sits above them — defining how data becomes a product, how that product is governed, and how value realization is tracked.

In short: Maysano turns data assets into accountable, outcome-driven products.
