# Admin  
*(Canonical: Platform Administrator)*

The Admin in Maysano owns the **platform environment** and ensures that the system remains secure, stable, and correctly configured.

This role is responsible for operational integrity — not for business logic or product structure.

If the Outcome Owner defines direction, the Product Manager structures products, and the Steward safeguards governance, the Admin ensures the platform runs reliably.

---

## Role Essence

The Admin owns the **operational layer** of Maysano.

This includes:

- User and role management  
- Access configuration  
- Tenant settings  
- Integration setup  
- Environment configuration  

The Admin ensures that the right people have the right access to the right capabilities.

---

## Core Accountability

The Admin is accountable for:

- Platform configuration
- Access control enforcement
- Role assignment integrity
- Tenant-level settings
- Security and operational stability

If the platform becomes misconfigured or insecure, the Admin has failed.

---

## Key Responsibilities

### 1) Manage Users and Roles

The Admin:

- Assigns roles to users
- Maintains user access levels
- Ensures separation of duties
- Removes access when required

Access must reflect organizational structure and governance policy.

---

### 2) Configure Tenant and Environment Settings

The Admin manages:

- Organizational configuration
- Feature enablement
- Environment-level controls
- System-wide defaults

These settings shape how Maysano behaves across all roles.

---

### 3) Manage Integrations

The Admin:

- Configures external integrations
- Manages API credentials and connectivity
- Ensures secure communication with connected systems
- Oversees integration-level permissions

Integration configuration must not compromise governance boundaries.

---

### 4) Enforce Access Controls

The Admin ensures that:

- Governance roles are respected
- Sensitive configuration is protected
- Access rights are auditable
- Role boundaries are enforced technically

The Admin enforces separation of concerns at the platform level.

---

### 5) Support Operational Stability

The Admin:

- Monitors operational signals
- Troubleshoots configuration issues
- Coordinates environment updates
- Ensures the platform remains available and consistent

---

## Explicit Non-Responsibilities

The Admin does not:

- Define business objectives
- Define outcome KPIs
- Define product scope
- Approve governance components
- Decide product structure

Operational authority does not extend into business or governance ownership.

---

## Decision Authority

The Admin has final authority over:

- Role assignments
- Platform configuration
- Access control enforcement
- Integration settings

Platform integrity overrides convenience.

---

## Primary Outputs in Maysano

The Admin maintains:

- User-role mappings
- Tenant configuration settings
- Integration configuration
- Access control definitions
- Operational configuration state

---

## Collaboration Model

The Admin collaborates with:

- **Outcome Owner** — when strategic visibility or access affects decision-making
- **Product Manager** — when access models or integrations affect product deployment
- **Steward** — when governance rules require technical enforcement

The Admin ensures the platform structure supports — but does not redefine — role authority.

---

## Interaction with AI

AI may assist the Admin by:

- Summarizing configuration state
- Highlighting potential access inconsistencies
- Suggesting configuration improvements
- Assisting in integration diagnostics

AI does not execute changes without Admin approval.

---

## Success Indicators

An Admin is successful when:

- Access is correctly enforced
- Platform configuration remains stable
- Integrations operate securely
- Governance separation is technically enforced
- Operational incidents are minimized

The Admin ensures that Maysano remains a controlled and reliable operating environment.
