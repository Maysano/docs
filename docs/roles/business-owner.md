# Outcome Owner  
*(Canonical: Business Outcome Owner)*

The Outcome Owner in Maysano defines **why** the organization invests in data products and what success means at the business level.

This role owns strategic intent. It does not own delivery mechanics.

The Outcome Owner ensures that every data product exists for a measurable business reason.

---

## Role Essence

The Outcome Owner owns the **purpose and success criteria** of data products.

- Defines strategic objectives
- Defines measurable outcome KPIs
- Validates that products remain aligned to business priorities

Without a clearly defined Outcome Owner, data products risk becoming technically correct but strategically irrelevant.

---

## Core Accountability

The Outcome Owner is accountable for:

- Business objectives
- Outcome KPIs
- Strategic alignment between data products and business intent
- Clear definition of success

If success cannot be measured, the objective is incomplete.

---

## Key Responsibilities

### 1) Define Business Objectives

The Outcome Owner defines:

- What business problem is being addressed
- Why the organization invests in solving it
- What improvement is expected
- What timeline matters

Objectives should be:

- Explicit
- Measurable
- Time-bound (where applicable)
- Prioritized

---

### 2) Define Outcome KPIs

Outcome KPIs measure business impact — not product execution.

Examples include:

- Revenue impact
- Cost reduction
- Customer satisfaction
- Risk reduction
- Operational improvement

Outcome KPIs must:

- Have a baseline
- Have a target
- Be measurable over time

---

### 3) Validate Alignment

The Outcome Owner validates:

- Which data products support which objectives
- Whether outcome KPIs are realistically influenced by those products
- Whether priorities need adjustment

Alignment is reviewed periodically — not only once.

---

### 4) Approve Success Criteria

The Outcome Owner confirms when:

- An objective is adequately defined
- An outcome KPI is correctly framed
- A data product is aligned to strategic goals

---

## Explicit Non-Responsibilities

The Outcome Owner does not:

- Define product structure
- Define internal KPIs
- Select governance components
- Approve governance templates
- Configure platform settings
- Manage technical implementation

These responsibilities belong to other roles.

---

## Decision Authority

The Outcome Owner has final authority over:

- Business objectives
- Outcome KPI definitions
- Strategic prioritization
- Acceptance of success metrics

No product decision should override strategic intent.

---

## Primary Outputs in Maysano

An Outcome Owner maintains:

- Defined objectives
- Outcome KPIs linked to objectives
- Strategic notes and justification
- Mapping between objectives and supporting data products

---

## Collaboration Model

The Outcome Owner collaborates with:

- **Product Manager** — to ensure product scope supports objectives
- **Steward** — to ensure governance does not block strategic execution
- **Admin** — only where access or structural issues impact objectives

The Outcome Owner defines direction. Others operationalize it.

---

## Interaction with AI

AI can support the Outcome Owner by:

- Stress-testing objective clarity
- Suggesting measurable KPI framing
- Identifying ambiguity in success criteria
- Exploring scenario impacts

AI may propose refinements. The Outcome Owner approves or rejects them.

---

## Success Indicators

An Outcome Owner is successful when:

- Objectives are clear and measurable
- Outcome KPIs are consistently tracked
- Products are aligned to strategy
- Business impact can be demonstrated
- Strategy remains adaptable but not vague

The Outcome Owner ensures that data products serve purpose — not just structure.
