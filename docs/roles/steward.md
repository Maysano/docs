# Steward  
*(Canonical: Data Product System Steward)*

The Steward in Maysano owns the **governance system**, not individual data products.

This role ensures that governance components remain reusable, consistent, and scalable across the organization.

If the Product Manager owns the product, the Steward owns the governance fabric that makes products trustworthy.

---

## Role Essence

The Steward owns the **quality and consistency of reusable governance components**.

This includes:

- Data Quality (DQ) profiles  
- SLA profiles  
- Access profiles  
- Pricing profiles (where applicable)  
- Governance templates  
- Component lifecycle management  

The Steward ensures that governance remains structured and reusable rather than fragmented and product-specific.

---

## Core Accountability

The Steward is accountable for:

- Governance library integrity
- Reusable component consistency
- Governance standardization
- Component lifecycle (creation, approval, versioning, deprecation)
- Preventing governance drift

If governance becomes inconsistent or duplicated unnecessarily, the Steward has failed.

---

## Key Responsibilities

### 1) Maintain the Governance Library

The Steward:

- Creates reusable governance components
- Reviews new component proposals
- Ensures components follow structural standards
- Avoids unnecessary duplication
- Maintains clear naming and versioning

Governance components should be reusable across multiple products.

---

### 2) Review Product Governance Coverage

The Steward evaluates whether:

- Selected components fit the product use case
- Required governance areas are covered
- DQ, SLA, Access, and other policies are coherent
- No structural gaps exist

The Steward reviews — but does not define — product scope.

---

### 3) Approve or Reject New Governance Components

When a Product Manager proposes a new profile:

- The Steward evaluates necessity
- Checks overlap with existing profiles
- Ensures structural compliance
- Approves, refines, or rejects the proposal

Reuse is preferred over creation.

---

### 4) Manage Component Lifecycle

The Steward manages:

- Versioning of governance components
- Deprecation policies
- Migration paths when components evolve
- Structural updates aligned with standards

Governance evolution must remain traceable.

---

### 5) Define Governance Standards

The Steward defines:

- Naming conventions
- Required fields and validation rules
- Acceptance criteria for governance components
- Governance templates

These standards enable scale and interoperability.

---

## Explicit Non-Responsibilities

The Steward does not:

- Define business objectives
- Define outcome KPIs
- Define product scope
- Own product internal KPIs
- Configure platform infrastructure

Governance oversight does not extend into business strategy or product ownership.

---

## Decision Authority

The Steward has final authority over:

- Approval of governance components
- Governance template standards
- Reusable profile lifecycle
- Acceptance criteria for governance consistency

No product can override governance standards.

---

## Primary Outputs in Maysano

The Steward maintains:

- Governance library components
- DQ, SLA, Access, Pricing profiles
- Governance templates
- Versioned governance standards
- Governance validation rules

---

## Collaboration Model

The Steward collaborates with:

- **Product Manager** — to ensure proper component selection and reuse
- **Outcome Owner** — indirectly, when governance impacts strategic measurability
- **Admin** — when access policies intersect with platform enforcement

The Steward safeguards consistency. The Product Manager applies governance to products.

---

## Interaction with AI

AI can support the Steward by:

- Detecting governance inconsistencies
- Identifying duplicate or overlapping components
- Suggesting reusable profiles
- Validating structural completeness

AI can recommend. The Steward approves.

---

## Success Indicators

A Steward is successful when:

- Governance components are reused across products
- Governance remains consistent over time
- New components are created only when necessary
- Standards are clear and adopted
- Governance supports scale without slowing innovation

The Steward ensures that governance is an enabler — not an obstacle.
